•
Applied statistical modelling and machine learning techniques in R to analyse real-world datasets, with a focus on regression, Poisson modelling, and logistic regression.
•
Developed and interpreted linear regression models, analysing trends in baseball team salaries from 1990 to 2010 using the Lahman dataset.
•
Implemented multiple regression for count data, modelling the number of runs scored by players based on their attributes (e.g., age, height, and playing position) while handling missing data and ensuring dataset integrity.
•
Conducted Poisson regression analysis to assess the impact of player attributes on scoring performance, evaluating model assumptions, and interpreting predictor significance using ANOVA.
•
Explored mixed-effects models, incorporating team-level random effects to analyse variations in player performance across different teams.
•
Applied Lasso regression for logistic classification, optimising a model to predict division winners based on team performance metrics, using cross-validation to select key predictors.
•
Implemented model evaluation techniques such as residual analysis, ROC curves, Youden’s index, and confusion matrices to assess classification performance and interpret predictive accuracy.
•
Leveraged advanced R libraries (tidyverse, glmnet, lme4, caret, pROC) to execute data wrangling, visualisation, and statistical modelling efficiently.
